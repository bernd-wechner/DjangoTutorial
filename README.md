# DjangoTutorial

A very simple little code base the intent of which is to implement examples from the stock standard Django Tutorials, to help in learning and in diagnosing and demonstrating issues. As a github repo examples can easily be linked to with a URL for support questions for example, in a very small, stripped down envrionment that loses all the complexity of a real project's context.
